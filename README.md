# Twitter-Giveaway-Bot

This was a fun little side project that I did. Pretty much had a cron job run this script at set time intervals, searches for giveaway tweets and retweets them to enter while obeying Twitter rate limits. Also had a nice email logger so I would get updated on the bot status while I was at school. 

I actually won a video game and a custom drawing which was nice, however it started entering some inappropriate giveaways for weird stuff so I decided to can it. :joy:

Feel free to study/use it as you please.
